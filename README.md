## a little about me
My name is **Jake Rogillio**. I am 25 years old and for as long as I can remember I have had a facination with computers.
After a string of unfullfilling jobs, I have decided to become a **self-taught front end developer**.
This is the start of my journey, and I invite you to follow along and see what we can create!
